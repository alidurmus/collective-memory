# HR QuerySet Error Resolution Report

**Issue Code**: ERR-DJANGO-250112-001  
**Report Date**: 12 Ocak 2025  
**Responsible Developer**: AI Assistant (Context7 QMS)  
**Resolution Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Problem Definition & Impact

### Original Error
```
TypeError at /erp/hr/reports/leave/
Cannot filter a query once a slice has been taken.
Exception Location: django/db/models/query.py, line 1505, in _filter_or_exclude
```

### Impact Assessment
- **Critical**: HR Leave Report page completely inaccessible
- **User Experience**: 500 Internal Server Error for users accessing `/erp/hr/reports/leave/`
- **System Functionality**: HR reporting system partially broken
- **Business Impact**: Unable to view leave request statistics and reports

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Analysis
The error occurred in the `hr_leave_report` function in `erp/views/main_views.py` due to improper Django QuerySet usage:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE:
leave_requests = LeaveRequest.objects.select_related(
    'employee', 'leave_type'
).order_by('-start_date')[:50]  # QuerySet sliced here

pending_requests = leave_requests.filter(status='pending').count()  # ERROR: Cannot filter after slice
approved_requests = leave_requests.filter(status='approved').count()  # ERROR: Cannot filter after slice
```

### Django QuerySet Behavior
- **Issue**: Once a QuerySet is sliced (using `[:n]`), Django evaluates it and converts it to a list
- **Consequence**: Cannot call `.filter()` on an already-sliced QuerySet
- **Error Type**: `TypeError: Cannot filter a query once a slice has been taken`

## Applied Solution

### Code Fix Implementation
**File**: `erp/views/main_views.py`  
**Function**: `hr_leave_report` (lines 1715-1730)

#### Before (Broken):
```python
@login_required
def hr_leave_report(request):
    """Leave Report"""
    leave_requests = LeaveRequest.objects.select_related(
        'employee', 'leave_type'
    ).order_by('-start_date')[:50]
    
    pending_requests = leave_requests.filter(status='pending').count()
    approved_requests = leave_requests.filter(status='approved').count()
    
    context = {
        'page_title': _('Leave Report'),
        'leave_requests': leave_requests,
        'pending_requests': pending_requests,
        'approved_requests': approved_requests,
    }
    return render(request, 'erp/hr/leave_report.html', context)
```

#### After (Fixed):
```python
@login_required
def hr_leave_report(request):
    """Leave Report"""
    # Base QuerySet for statistics (without slicing)
    base_queryset = LeaveRequest.objects.select_related('employee', 'leave_type')
    
    # Get recent leave requests for display (with slicing)
    leave_requests = base_queryset.order_by('-start_date')[:50]
    
    # Calculate statistics from base QuerySet (not sliced)
    pending_requests = base_queryset.filter(status='pending').count()
    approved_requests = base_queryset.filter(status='approved').count()
    rejected_requests = base_queryset.filter(status='rejected').count()
    total_requests = base_queryset.count()
    
    context = {
        'page_title': _('Leave Report'),
        'leave_requests': leave_requests,
        'pending_requests': pending_requests,
        'approved_requests': approved_requests,
        'rejected_requests': rejected_requests,
        'total_requests': total_requests,
    }
    return render(request, 'erp/hr/leave_report.html', context)
```

### Solution Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Base QuerySet for statistics, sliced QuerySet for display
2. **Enhanced Statistics**: Added `rejected_requests` and `total_requests` for better reporting
3. **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper `select_related`
4. **Maintainability**: Clear, readable code structure

## Verification & Testing

### Test Results
All HR report pages tested successfully:

| Page | URL | Status | Response |
|------|-----|--------|----------|
| **Leave Report** | `/erp/hr/reports/leave/` | ✅ **200 OK** | Working perfectly |
| **Performance Report** | `/erp/hr/reports/performance/` | ✅ **200 OK** | Working perfectly |
| **Payroll Report** | `/erp/hr/reports/payroll/` | ✅ **200 OK** | Working perfectly |
| **Training Programs** | `/erp/hr/training/` | ✅ **200 OK** | Working perfectly |

### Django System Check
```bash
python manage.py check --deploy
System check identified 6 issues (0 silenced).
```
