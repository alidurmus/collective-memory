```

#### **Pre-Rule vs Post-Rule Comparison**
| Aspect | Before Rule | After Rule |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Testing** | ❌ Optional/Inconsistent | ✅ MANDATORY after every change |
| **Quality** | ❌ Variable quality | ✅ Consistent high quality |
| **Error Detection** | ❌ Post-deployment discovery | ✅ Pre-deployment verification |
| **Rollback Need** | ❌ High risk | ✅ Minimal risk |
| **System Health** | ❌ Unpredictable | ✅ Guaranteed stability |
