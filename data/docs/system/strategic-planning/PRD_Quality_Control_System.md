Version: 1.0

Date: 12 Temmuz 2025

Status: Draft

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

This document outlines the product requirements for the Web-Based Quality Control and Production Tracking System. It serves as a guide for the development team, stakeholders, and project managers, detailing the system's objectives, target users, features, and technical considerations. The system aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and monitoring production and quality control processes within a manufacturing facility.

### **1.2 Product Overview**

The Web-Based Quality Control and Production Tracking System is an application designed to digitally manage, monitor, and report the entire lifecycle of materials and products within a production facility. This includes the acceptance of raw materials, progression through various production stages, execution of quality controls, final inspection of completed products, and preparation for shipment. The system is intended to enhance traceability, ensure adherence to quality standards, improve operational efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making. It will also integrate Content Management System (CMS) functionalities for managing an associated external website.

## **2\. Goals and Objectives**

The primary goals of the Web-Based Quality Control and Production Tracking System are:

* **Enhance Traceability:** Provide end-to-end tracking of materials and products throughout the production process.  
* **Ensure Quality Standards:** Implement robust quality control mechanisms at various stages (incoming, in-process, final) to maintain high product quality.  
* **Improve Efficiency:** Streamline production workflows, reduce manual data entry, and optimize resource utilization.  
* **Support Decision-Making:** Offer comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to enable informed decisions by management and operational staff.  
* **Centralize Data Management:** Provide a single source of truth for all production and quality-related data.  
* **Facilitate Collaboration:** Improve communication and information sharing between different departments and user roles.

## **3\. Target Audience and User Roles**

The system will be used by various personnel within the manufacturing facility. Key user roles include:

* **Administrator:** Manages system settings, user accounts, roles, permissions, and overall system configuration. Has full access to all modules.  
* **Production Planning Specialist:** Creates, plans, and manages work orders. Monitors production schedules and overall workflow.  
* **Operator:** Interacts with the system on the production floor, records production progress, reports issues, and may perform basic quality checks.  
* **Quality Control Specialist (QCS) / Officer:** Defines quality criteria, performs detailed quality inspections (incoming, in-process, final), records test results, and manages non-conformities.  
* **Purchasing Officer:** Manages material definitions and supplier information, potentially involved in incoming material quality processes.  
* **General User (View-Only):** May have read-only access to certain reports or dashboards depending on their function.
