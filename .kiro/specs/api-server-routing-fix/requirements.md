# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collective Memory API server is experiencing Flask routing conflicts due to duplicate endpoint function mappings. Specifically, the `api_search` function is defined twice with the same route `/api/search`, causing an AssertionError when the Flask application starts. This issue prevents the API server from running and needs to be resolved to restore system functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API server to start without routing conflicts, so that I can use the Collective Memory system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server is started THEN the system SHALL start without Flask routing errors
2. WHEN duplicate route definitions exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single endpoint
3. WHEN the `/api/search` endpoint is accessed THEN it SHALL handle both GET and POST requests correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clean and maintainable API routing code, so that future modifications don't introduce similar conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the API routing code THEN there SHALL be no duplicate function names for the same endpoint
2. WHEN adding new routes THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN routes serve similar purposes THEN they SHALL be consolidated rather than duplicated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the search functionality to work consistently, so that I can perform searches via both GET and POST methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making a GET request to `/api/search` THEN the system SHALL process query parameters correctly
2. WHEN making a POST request to `/api/search` THEN the system SHALL process JSON body parameters correctly
3. WHEN using either method THEN the response format SHALL be consistent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API server to handle the datetime deprecation warning, so that the code is future-proof.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server starts THEN there SHALL be no deprecation warnings about datetime.utcnow()
2. WHEN timestamp operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use timezone-aware datetime objects
3. WHEN upgrading Python versions THEN the datetime usage SHALL remain compatible
