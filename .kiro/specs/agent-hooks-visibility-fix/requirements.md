# Agent Hooks Visibility Fix Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Hooks system in Collective Memory has been implemented but is experiencing visibility and functionality issues. Users cannot see or interact with hooks properly in the Kiro IDE interface. This feature aims to fix the integration between the hook system and Kiro's UI, ensuring hooks are visible, manageable, and functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all available agent hooks in the Kiro IDE sidebar, so that I can monitor and manage them easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open Kiro IDE THEN the system SHALL display an "Agent Hooks" panel in the sidebar
2. WHEN the hooks panel loads THEN the system SHALL show all configured hooks with their status
3. WHEN hooks are running THEN the system SHALL display real-time status indicators
4. WHEN I click on a hook THEN the system SHALL show detailed information and controls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start and stop the hook manager from the Kiro interface, so that I can control hook execution without using command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Start Hooks" button THEN the system SHALL launch the hook manager process
2. WHEN I click "Stop Hooks" button THEN the system SHALL gracefully shutdown the hook manager
3. WHEN hook manager status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL show success/failure notifications in Turkish

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable/disable individual hooks from the UI, so that I can customize which hooks are active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I toggle a hook switch THEN the system SHALL update the hook configuration file
2. WHEN hook status changes THEN the system SHALL reflect the change in the UI immediately
3. WHEN I disable a hook THEN the system SHALL stop executing that hook
4. WHEN I enable a hook THEN the system SHALL start monitoring for that hook's triggers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually execute hooks from the UI, so that I can test hooks or run them on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Execute" on a manual hook THEN the system SHALL run that hook immediately
2. WHEN hook execution starts THEN the system SHALL show progress indicator
3. WHEN hook execution completes THEN the system SHALL display results in Turkish
4. WHEN hook execution fails THEN the system SHALL show error details with troubleshooting tips

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see hook execution history and logs, so that I can monitor hook performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hooks execute THEN the system SHALL log all activities with timestamps
2. WHEN I view hook history THEN the system SHALL show recent executions with status
3. WHEN I click on a log entry THEN the system SHALL show detailed execution information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight them with clear error messages in Turkish

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hooks to work correctly with Windows file paths and commands, so that the system functions properly on Windows development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hooks execute on Windows THEN the system SHALL use correct Windows path separators
2. WHEN running commands THEN the system SHALL use Windows-compatible command syntax
3. WHEN monitoring files THEN the system SHALL handle Windows file system events correctly
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL save files to Windows-compatible paths

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hook configuration validation and error reporting, so that I can identify and fix configuration issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hook configuration loads THEN the system SHALL validate all hook definitions
2. WHEN configuration errors exist THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages in Turkish
3. WHEN I fix configuration errors THEN the system SHALL automatically reload the configuration
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful configuration loading

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hooks to integrate with the existing Collective Memory project structure, so that they work seamlessly with the current codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hooks run tests THEN the system SHALL use the correct test commands for the project
2. WHEN hooks format code THEN the system SHALL respect the project's formatting configuration
3. WHEN hooks generate reports THEN the system SHALL save them to the existing docs/reports structure
4. WHEN hooks monitor files THEN the system SHALL watch the correct project directories

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hook notifications and feedback in Turkish, so that I can understand system messages in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hooks execute THEN the system SHALL display status messages in Turkish
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show error messages in Turkish
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL show success confirmations in Turkish
4. WHEN providing help text THEN the system SHALL display instructions in Turkish

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hooks to handle missing dependencies gracefully, so that the system continues working even when some tools are not installed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a required tool is missing THEN the system SHALL show a helpful installation message in Turkish
2. WHEN dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL disable related hooks temporarily
3. WHEN tools become available THEN the system SHALL automatically re-enable the hooks
4. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear status information
