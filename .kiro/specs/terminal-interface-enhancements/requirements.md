# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collective Memory terminal interface currently has basic functionality working (database connection, file search, statistics), but two critical features need enhancement: Interactive Mode and Semantic Search. The interactive mode currently fails with EOF errors and infinite loops, while semantic search functionality is completely missing from the command-line interface. These enhancements will provide users with a more powerful and user-friendly CLI experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a stable interactive mode in the terminal interface, so that I can perform multiple operations without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start interactive mode THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and command prompt
2. WHEN I enter commands in interactive mode THEN they SHALL be processed without EOF errors
3. WHEN I type "help" THEN the system SHALL display available commands and usage examples
4. WHEN I type "quit" or "exit" THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate the interactive session
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error and return to the command prompt
6. WHEN I press Ctrl+C THEN the system SHALL handle the interrupt gracefully and exit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want semantic search functionality in the terminal interface, so that I can find files based on meaning rather than just keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the semantic command THEN the system SHALL perform AI-powered semantic search
2. WHEN semantic search is performed THEN results SHALL be ranked by semantic relevance
3. WHEN semantic search completes THEN results SHALL include relevance scores and context highlights
4. WHEN enhanced query engine is available THEN semantic search SHALL use advanced AI features
5. WHEN enhanced query engine is not available THEN semantic search SHALL fall back to keyword-based search with a warning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced search capabilities in interactive mode, so that I can refine my searches and explore results interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a search in interactive mode THEN I SHALL be able to view detailed results
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN I SHALL be able to navigate through them with pagination
3. WHEN I want to refine a search THEN I SHALL be able to add filters and modifiers
4. WHEN I find an interesting result THEN I SHALL be able to view the full file content
5. WHEN I want to export results THEN I SHALL be able to save them to different formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent command suggestions and auto-completion in interactive mode, so that I can work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type partial commands THEN the system SHALL suggest completions
2. WHEN I press Tab THEN the system SHALL auto-complete commands and file paths
3. WHEN I type invalid commands THEN the system SHALL suggest similar valid commands
4. WHEN I use command history THEN I SHALL be able to navigate previous commands with arrow keys
5. WHEN I want to repeat a command THEN I SHALL be able to use command history

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced search options and filters, so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search THEN I SHALL be able to filter by file type, date, size, and other metadata
2. WHEN I search THEN I SHALL be able to use boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
3. WHEN I search THEN I SHALL be able to use regular expressions
4. WHEN I search THEN I SHALL be able to search within specific directories
5. WHEN I search THEN I SHALL be able to exclude certain patterns or directories

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time feedback and progress indicators, so that I know the system is working on long-running operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexing files THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with current file being processed
2. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL show a spinner or progress indicator
3. WHEN operations take longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide status updates
4. WHEN operations can be cancelled THEN the system SHALL respond to Ctrl+C gracefully
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL show completion time and summary

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery, so that the terminal interface remains stable and informative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with user feedback
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and suggestions
4. WHEN memory issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and customization options, so that I can tailor the terminal interface to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the interface THEN I SHALL be able to load custom configuration files
2. WHEN I want to change settings THEN I SHALL be able to modify them through commands
3. WHEN I want to save preferences THEN the system SHALL persist them between sessions
4. WHEN I want to reset settings THEN I SHALL be able to restore defaults
5. WHEN I want to export settings THEN I SHALL be able to share configuration with others
