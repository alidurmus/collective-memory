# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collective Memory API server currently has WebSocket support disabled due to compatibility issues on Windows systems. This affects real-time features like live search updates, system monitoring notifications, and team collaboration features. The system needs to implement a Windows-compatible WebSocket solution that maintains all real-time functionality while working reliably across different Windows versions and configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows developer, I want WebSocket functionality to work reliably on my system, so that I can use real-time features like live search updates and system notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server starts on Windows THEN WebSocket support SHALL be enabled without compatibility errors
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL remain stable across different Windows versions (Windows 10, 11)
3. WHEN real-time events occur THEN they SHALL be transmitted via WebSocket without connection drops
4. WHEN the system detects Windows platform THEN it SHALL use Windows-compatible WebSocket configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want WebSocket connections to handle Windows-specific networking constraints, so that the system works in corporate environments with firewalls and proxies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are made through corporate firewalls THEN they SHALL establish successfully using fallback mechanisms
2. WHEN proxy servers are present THEN WebSocket connections SHALL negotiate properly
3. WHEN Windows Defender or antivirus software is active THEN WebSocket connections SHALL not be blocked
4. WHEN network interfaces change (VPN connect/disconnect) THEN WebSocket connections SHALL reconnect automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time search updates to work on Windows, so that I can see live search results and indexing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is performed THEN search events SHALL be emitted via WebSocket to connected clients
2. WHEN file indexing occurs THEN indexing progress SHALL be broadcast in real-time
3. WHEN system status changes THEN status updates SHALL be pushed to the frontend
4. WHEN multiple clients are connected THEN all clients SHALL receive real-time updates simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want team collaboration features to work on Windows, so that I can participate in real-time messaging and shared workspaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members join a workspace THEN join/leave events SHALL be broadcast via WebSocket
2. WHEN messages are sent in team chat THEN they SHALL be delivered in real-time to all participants
3. WHEN collaborative editing occurs THEN changes SHALL be synchronized via WebSocket
4. WHEN team notifications are triggered THEN they SHALL be delivered instantly to online team members

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebSocket error handling to be robust on Windows, so that temporary connection issues don't break the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. WHEN WebSocket initialization fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling mode gracefully
3. WHEN connection errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with Windows-specific diagnostic information
4. WHEN WebSocket support is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want WebSocket configuration to be flexible for Windows environments, so that I can adapt the system to different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring WebSocket settings THEN Windows-specific options SHALL be available (transport methods, timeouts)
2. WHEN deploying in different Windows environments THEN WebSocket configuration SHALL be adjustable via environment variables
3. WHEN troubleshooting WebSocket issues THEN diagnostic tools SHALL provide Windows-specific information
4. WHEN WebSocket performance needs optimization THEN Windows-specific tuning options SHALL be available
